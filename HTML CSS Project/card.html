			<p>Due to their beauty, Siberian Huskies are one of the most wrongly purchased breeds around. Many do not take into consideration their temperaments and 
				particular quirks and are often left with an unruly, albeit beautiful, dog. Many Siberian Huskies are either lost, killed, or given to shelters 
				due to uninformed owners. If you are thinking of purchasing a Siberian Husky, take a lot of time learning about the breed.
